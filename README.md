# Smartphone Data Cleaning Project


In this project, I have developed a comprehensive data cleaning pipeline tailored for smartphone data collected through web scraping with Beautiful Soup. The raw data, which includes various smartphone specifications and details, often contains noise, missing values, and inconsistencies that need to be addressed to ensure the dataset's quality and reliability.

Key Features:
Data Collection: Utilized Beautiful Soup to scrape smartphone data from multiple web sources, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive dataset.
Data Cleaning: Applied various data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, correct errors, and standardize formats.
Data Transformation: Structured the cleaned data into a consistent and usable format, making it ready for analysis or integration into other projects.
By implementing this project, I aimed to highlight the importance of data cleaning in the data science pipeline and demonstrate effective methods for transforming raw scraped data into a high-quality, usable dataset.
